**Binary Search Algorithm Comparison in Python**
Created a Python program that compares two binary search
implementations on a sorted dataset. The project reads integers from a file,
performs both search variants, and measures execution time. It demonstrates
algorithm optimization, performance analysis, and user input validation.
